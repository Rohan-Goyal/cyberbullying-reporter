My extension file for RWA, because I don't want to get a Chrome Developer Account
This is basically a chrome extension which allows RWA students to report any incident of cyberbullying they see online to a database, where it will be reviewed and acted upon by the ABC. 
This extension is only meant for Raffles World Academy Students; please don't download it otherwise. Also please refrain from spamming us, as much as you may like to.


## Instructions
First, download the CRX file from the repository. Then go to the URL chrome://extensions in Google Chrome.  

Make sure developer mode is switched on (the small switch in the top right corner).   

Drag and drop the CRX file from your downloads into the chrome extensions window.   

Click the 'Add Extension' button in the dialogue box.  

A small blue hand should appear in your Chrome Extensions Bar.   

If you see cyberbullying on any site, simply click the blue hand.  

A web form will pop up which you can fill in. The URL and timestamp will be automatically logged.  

Depending on the site you are reporting from, the message and account might be already filled. If so, simply check over them and correct any errors. 

Once the form is filled, click report and click 'OK' on the dialogue box. Then close the window and return to whatever you were doing.
